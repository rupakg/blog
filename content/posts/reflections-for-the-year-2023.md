I have been reflecting on my past year for a few years now, but I did not publish them. This year I wanted to start the trend. Reflecting on my goals for the year, evaluating how I did, and rethinking how I spent my time. It has always provided me with clarity for the next year. Continuing what I started and starting something new has always been exciting for me, something to look forward to. Writing down the reflections, helps me see the gaps and the course corrections I need to make. It also helps me reflect on what went well, and what to improve on, and for all the things I am thankful & grateful for.

It has been a blessed year overall with a multitude of changes at work and in my personal life. I am grateful to God for providing me with the time, energy, good health, and resources to carry out the things I planned. I am thankful and ever so grateful to my family for always supporting and encouraging my ideas and routines. I am blessed to have my mother live with me and my sister & her loving family for their love & support.

I am grateful to my leadership and my team at work, and the support they provide. It has been a challenging year at work but we came through with tenacity, perseverance, thoughtfulness, and teamwork. I am proud of what we have collectively achieved, under pressure, amongst change and realignments.
