I failed my reading challenge in 2024. I read 32 of 48 books. I [read 56 books in 2023 and challenged myself](https://rupakganguly.com/posts/challenge-yourself-into-a-reading-habit/), and 25 books in 2022. I think I have found my sweet spot: 36 books a year, which is three books a month. I like a challenge, so I always have a stretch goal. I hope to surprise myself!

But, I feel it is not about the number of books you read. Itâ€™s about the discipline and the routine to find time, to read, everyday. Even if it is 10 mins a day. 

If you are thinking of forming a good habit in 2025, start reading. I wrote about my mindset, strategies, challenges, apps, and tools on [How to Read 24 or More Books in a Year](https://rupakganguly.com/posts/how-to-read-24-or-more-books-in-a-year/). Create a reading list, set a reading challenge, read every day, and track your progress. You will thank yourself later.
