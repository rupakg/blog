I failed my reading challenge in 2024. I read 32 of 48 books. I [read 56 books in 2023 and challenged myself](https://rupakganguly.com/posts/challenge-yourself-into-a-reading-habit/), and 25 books in 2022. I think I have found my sweet spot: 36 books a year, which is three books a month. I like a challenge, so I always have a stretch goal. I hope to surprise myself!

But, I feel it is not about the number of books you read. Itâ€™s about the discipline and the routine to find time, to read, everyday. Even if it is 10 mins a day. 

If you are thinking of forming a good habit in 2025, start reading. I wrote about my mindset, strategies, challenges, apps, and tools on [How to Read 24 or More Books in a Year](https://rupakganguly.com/posts/how-to-read-24-or-more-books-in-a-year/). Create a reading list, set a reading challenge, read every day, and track your progress. You will thank yourself later.

[My 2024 books]

## Excuses we give ourselves

I have been there, so donâ€™t sweat it. It took me some while to get into a routine and set away some time for reading. I have been struggling with getting into a discipline with my guitar practice. It takes time and a conscious effort to get into a routine. So, donâ€™t give up.

Some of my excuses:

- I don't have time
    - We all have time. Its just that we don't have the time set to read. You just have block some time. 10 mins, everyday. Same time. Put it in your calendar or set a reminder.
- I am too busy
    - We are all busy. Life happens. We have to find time for things we live to do. Develop love for books and reading
- Where do I find books?
    - Your can borrow from your nearest library. You can read audio books on Libby or Audible. You can buy books at Amazon, ThriftBooks or at your local bookstore.
- What should I read?
    - Ask the librarian and they will guide you.
    - Follow people on Goodreads. Check out their reading lists
    - Check out Ryan Holidayâ€™s book list email newsletter
    - Check out Tim Ferrisâ€™ book list on his Fri newsletter
    - Talk to friends and ask what they read
    - Pick a combination of genres - fiction and non-fiction
- I have no motivation
    - Motivation helps drive a habit.
    - Love for reading will come from reading books that motivate you
    - For people like me who like challenges, a reading challenge could be your motivation.
- I will start next week
    - Procrastination is real, but small milestones for a bigger goal can be a solution
    - Make your milestone to complete 5 pages or a chapter or 5% of an audiobook. In no time you will have finished the book
    - Just start getting a book today, followed by reading 5 pages. Just do it.

## Being curious

- To be able to develop a reading habit, we have to be curious. We need some inspiration to develop a love for reading
- Pick a topic or subject that you know nothing about
- Find a book to read. Start with a small book and a relatively easier read
- Find books by authors that you loved in the past

## Routine

- Develop a daily reading routine
- Set aside 10 mins to read, everyday
- Track your progress
- Pick a time of day or night, when you donâ€™t have to fight with competing tasks or chores
- Stick to the routine. If you miss a day, pick up the next day

I hope you develop the love for reading this coming new year. If you already read, read some more. Challenge yourself. Write reviews and take notes of books you read. Share it with others. It is a lot of fun.
