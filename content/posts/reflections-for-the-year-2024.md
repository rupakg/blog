I have always taken the time to analyze my thoughts and reflect on the past year. Since last year, I  started writing about my reflections on the past year. 

Taking time to assess my yearly objectives, measure my progress, and analyze my time management has become a valuable practice. This exercise consistently brings a fresh perspective for the upcoming year. There's an inherent thrill in both maintaining ongoing projects and embarking on new ventures - it creates anticipation for what's ahead. The process of documenting these thoughts reveals areas needing adjustment and helps identify necessary changes in direction. Moreover, it provides an opportunity to celebrate successes, pinpoint areas for growth, and acknowledge the many blessings for which I'm appreciative.

## 🙏🏼 Gratitude

This year has been truly remarkable, filled with numerous transformations both professionally and personally. I find myself deeply thankful for the divine blessings that have provided me with abundant vitality, wellness, and means to accomplish my goals. My heart overflows with gratitude for my family's unwavering support and enthusiasm towards my endeavors and daily practices. Having my mother's presence in my home and the endless love and backing from my sister and her wonderful family fills me with immense joy.

My professional journey has been equally enriching, marked by the incredible support from both my leadership and team members. Despite facing significant workplace challenges, our collective spirit of determination, resilience, and collaborative effort has seen us through. Looking back, I feel an immense sense of pride in our team's achievements, especially considering the pressures we faced and the organizational changes we navigated. 

## 💼 Work

It was a bittersweet year at work. I was promoted and led a large team at the beginning of the year, and I was then let go at the end of the year, as part of a reduction in the workforce. Losing your job is never easy, but I always believed that “what happens, happens for good”. I am fortunate to have a loving and supportive family that has made it easier to traverse through the transition.
